# Machine Learning to Declare Convective Mode

## Data


## Methods


### Images


### Machine Learning
A deep-learning technique called a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to classify convective mode. Input images centered on the particular convective object (i.e., thunderstorm) are sized 136 by 136 pixels. A traditional training/validation/testing split of (will be listed later) is done to ensure the model performs as best as it can. Finally, a hundred epochs is used to adquately train the model.  A notebook on how the CNN was developed and trained can be found here. 

## Results
Since the poster can show so many results, this section can hopefully round out the rest of the results not seen as well as the figures shown on the poster. 

### Classification of Convective Mode
Using the aforementioned CNN, convective mode could be declared for each image generated. However, first we must address the training stages of the CNN model before proccedding to the next step.

#### Model Training

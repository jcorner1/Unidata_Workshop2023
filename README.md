# 2023 Unidata Workshop
Code, plots, and other information presented during the Unidata user workshop in June 2023

## Data
There are a few different types of data used in this project. Firstly, the model data used is HRRR. These data can be found at this Google Reposority. More information on HRRR can be found here. 

Since HRRR is being verified, an observational dataset is also needed. The data used here is the Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor (MRMS) reflectivity product. These data can be found at the Iowa State Mesonet Page. Finally, a notebook to download the data and also remove unneeded products from the netCDF file can be found here. The data is augmented to save storage space.
